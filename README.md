# Brain Tumor Challenge: Survival Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict the survival of patients with brain tumors using machine learning techniques. The Brain Tumor Challenge dataset provides clinical and genetic features of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive type of brain tumor.

## Dataset

The dataset contains clinical information of 191 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, including age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, as well as genetic features such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number variation. The dataset also includes the survival time in days and the survival status (1 = alive, 0 = dead) of each patient.

## Methodology

We plan to use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) to build predictive models that can accurately predict the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We will use Python and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.

## Results

We will evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We will also compare our models with the baseline models provided by the Brain Tumor Challenge.

## Conclusion

The ability to accurately predict the survival of patients with brain tumors can have a significant impact on their treatment and care. By applying machine learning techniques to the Brain Tumor Challenge dataset, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective and personalized treatments for patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
